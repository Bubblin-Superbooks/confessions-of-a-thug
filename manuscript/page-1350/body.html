There was nothing remarkable in it: but it seemed unaccountably fresh to me,&mdash;as though I had but left it yesterday.</p><p>Still I walked on silently, and my companion did not notice the agitation and surprise which must have been depicted on my features. We reached the house, a respectable one in appearance; and desiring me to be seated, he left me to bring the old man of whom we had spoken. When we entered, Alla! Alla!
