<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>You know the worst, Sahib&mdash;think of me as you will, I deserve it. I cannot justify the deed to myself, much less to you; and the only consolation I have&mdash;that it was the work of fate, of unerring destiny&mdash;is but a weak one, that gives way before the conviction of my own guilt. I must bear my curse, I must wither under it. I pray for death, and as often, too, pray that I may live, and that my measure of punishment may be allotted to me here, that my soul may not burn in Jehanum. I may now as well bring my history to a close, to the time when, by accepting your boon of life, I became dead to the world.</p></div> </div>
