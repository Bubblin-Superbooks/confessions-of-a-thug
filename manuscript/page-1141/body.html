Go for the Lughaees; he must be put under ground immediately. Now for the Saees."</p><p>We left the Khan's body, and went out; the others were waiting for us. "Where does he lie?" I asked.</p><p>"There," said one of the men; "he is fast asleep, and has been so for an hour."</p><p>"So much the better," said Peer Khan; "leave him to me."</p><p>I watched him and Motee as they approached the sleeper.
