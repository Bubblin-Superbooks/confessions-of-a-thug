A few there certainly were, who shut themselves up in an old fort which overhangs the river and commands the ford; but they kept within the walls, only firing a matchlock-shot or two whenever any of our marauders approached too near; we did not molest them, but set ourselves to work to levy as large a sum as possible.</p><p>As before, the advance guard had been entrusted to me, and I pursued the same system I had done at Oomraotee.
