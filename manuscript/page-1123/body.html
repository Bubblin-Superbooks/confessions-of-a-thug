But to prevent any noise being heard, suppose we propose to admit Motee and two or three others to sing and play,&mdash;I mean when the Khan has swallowed his first bottle. Motee has a sitar and a small drum with him, and its noise will drown all others."</p><p>"No, no!" said I; "others might be attracted by the singing, and come to hear it; it will not do; we must do our best and leave the rest to Alla. However we will see when the time comes."</p><p>The evening was far advanced, and everything around us was quiet. A few fires here and there throughout the camp marked where, at each, a solitary Pindharee cooked his last meal of the day;</p></div> </div>
