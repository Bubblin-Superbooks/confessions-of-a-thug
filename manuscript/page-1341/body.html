Those who had fled, joined by others of my men and some villagers, headed by my brave old father, issued from the gate, which the horsemen seeing, they drew off, and we got within the village in safety. They kept hovering about till mid-day, but out of the reach of our shot; and soon after noon, they all departed, and we saw no more of them. We had to pay for our shelter handsomely, however, for the Potail shut the gates of his village, and declared we should not pass out without having paid him a thousand rupees. I was for attacking him, plundering his village, and burning it after the Pindharee fashion; and we could have done it easily. But my father would not hear of it.</p></div> </div>
