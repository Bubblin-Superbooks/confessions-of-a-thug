But he spoke not&mdash;he was more than half-dead: misery and torture had done their utmost.</p><p>The Khan drew his sword. Again he cried "Speak!" as he raised the weapon above his head. I fancied I saw the old man's lips smile, and move as though he would have spoken; he cast his eyes upwards, but no word escaped him. The sword was quivering above his head in the nervous grasp of the Khan; and seeing he got no answer, it descended with its full force on the old man's forehead, almost dividing the head in two. Need I say he was instantly dead! I was satisfied; Ghuffoor Khan's cup too was full; for my own determination was made on that spot,&mdash;I swore it to myself as I looked at the dead, and rushed from the house.</p></div> </div>
