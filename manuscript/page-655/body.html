I had scarcely got beyond the small village by which the Durgah was surrounded, when I saw three carts with curtains to them carefully closed approaching. My heart beat quickly with hope, and I determined to return; one of them surely is hers, thought I, and I will await her coming in the Durgah.</p><p>"She comes!" cried I to Peer Khan, as he eagerly asked the cause of my quick return, "she comes!
