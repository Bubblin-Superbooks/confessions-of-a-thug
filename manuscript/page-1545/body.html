I, for one, heard your father say that he left her behind, as she was too young to be moved. You might get news of her at Eklï¿½ra, if you ever get out of this cursed hole."</p><p>But he now spoke to one bereft of sense&mdash;of any feeling save that of choking, withering, blighting agony. Why did not my heartstrings crack in that moment? Why did I live to drag a load of remorse with me to my grave? Yet it has even been so. I live, and I have borne my misery as best I could; to most I appear calm and cheerful, but the wound rankles in my heart; and could you but know my sufferings, Sahib, you would, perhaps, pity me.</p></div> </div>
