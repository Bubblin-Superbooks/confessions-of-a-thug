Now, Meer Sahib, believe that a man can be killed before he touches the ground."</p><p>"I must see you do it," said I; "this fellow held on by the cart for some moments. But come," I added to the men, "lift the body into the cart, we have no time to lose." They bundled it in, and we set off as rapidly as the bullocks could trot.</p><p>"What if he should revive with this jolting?" said I to Bhudrinath.</p><p>"Never fear," he replied; "if he does, he will only have to be killed over again; but depend upon it he is dead enough: no man ever survived the wrench you gave him&mdash;his neck is broken. The old Gooroo has taught you well, I see plainly."</p></div> </div>
