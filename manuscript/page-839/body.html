I asked.</p><p>"He is on a tattoo, a good strong beast," said the scout, "and has two others laden with him, and there are four men besides himself and Bhikaree."</p><p>"Good," said I. "Now, my lads, we must push on; the Sahoukar must see nothing of us for some days, and till then I shall avoid all others."</p></div> </div>
