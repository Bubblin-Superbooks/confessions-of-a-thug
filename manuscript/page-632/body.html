<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I was the daughter of humble parents, but I was, as you see me&mdash;they say I am beautiful; they married me to my husband,&mdash;so they said,&mdash;but they sold me. Sahib, he is old, he is a tyrant, he has beaten me with his shoe, and I have sworn on his Koran that I will no longer remain under his roof. Yes, I have sworn it: I would have fled yesterday, but I saw you, and I prayed Alla to send you, and he has done so. Now think of me what you please, but save me!" And she arose, and throwing herself at my feet clasped my knees. "You will not refuse me protection? if you do, and your heart is hard towards me, one thing alone remains&mdash;I have prepared a bitter draught, and to-morrow's sun will look upon my dead body."</p></div> </div>
