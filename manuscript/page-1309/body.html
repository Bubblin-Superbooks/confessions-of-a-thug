Of course the Moonshee will join them, and we may then as well think of strangling the king of Delhi, as of getting him."</p><p>"But how," said I, "how are the Feringhees upon us? Have you seen them?"</p><p>"No," said Ganesha, "but I have seen their people. A long string of camels have just arrived, with I know not how many red-coated sepoys to guard them&mdash;my curse be on them all!"</p></div> </div>
