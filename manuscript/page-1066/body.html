So rich was it, that the sahoukars of Nemawur, after purchasing all they could from us, were unable to find further funds to buy up the whole; and merchants from Oojein and Indoor, and all the neighbouring large cities, were sent for to our rich market.</p><p>In due time all had been purchased, and every man prepared to return as quickly as he could to his home, with the proceeds of his booty.</p></div> </div>
