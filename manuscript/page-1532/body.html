A narrow passage, between two high walls, which but just admitted of a man's passing along it, contained, about half-way down, two cells, more like the dens of wild beasts than aught else. They were more strongly grated than the last we had been in, and were not half the size. Far heavier irons than those we had last worn were fastened on our legs by a blacksmith, and we were thrust into our horrible abodes.</p><p>"Now," said the Darogha, "get out if you can, Meer Sahib. If walls and iron bars can hold you, you are pretty safe here, I think."</p></div> </div>
