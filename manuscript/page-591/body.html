"Bhowanee is propitious," said they, "in spite of this little display of her anger: the truth is, we had in some manner neglected her, but she is now satisfied."</p><p>"Since that is the case," said I, "we had better be stirring and doing something for the poor fellows; but what to do I know not. When did you say they were seized, Bhudrinath?"</p><p>"About the middle of the night."</p><p>"Then they are now in confinement somewhere or other, and it will be impossible to effect their release by day; a bribe I dare not offer, for they say Hussein Ali Khan, the Kotwal, is an upright man. When is it likely they will be brought before him?"</p></div> </div>
