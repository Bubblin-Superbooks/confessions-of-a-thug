One body therefore took a western course along the banks of the river, another an eastern one, and a third a middle course.</p><p>That which took the eastern road was the one with which Cheetoo remained, and with it were Ghuffoor Khan and myself.

I was now the sole companion of Ghuffoor Khan;</p></div> </div>
