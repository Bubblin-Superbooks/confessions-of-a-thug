They ran towards us in breathless anxiety and hope. Motee was first, and he threw himself into my arms. "We hastened on," he said, "from the last stage, hoping to overtake you in time; and when we saw the dead camel, how great was our suspense till we could find you! We saw the traces of the conflict, and some blood which had escaped your notice&mdash;which I have removed&mdash;and that added to our anxiety; but, Davee be praised! we have found you at last, and you are all safe. Is it not so?"</p></div> </div>
