You had better come; you will only have to pay a fine, and will be released; I swear this to you on the faith of a Rajpoot."</p><p>"I will neither trust you nor your master," said I; "you are a parcel of vagabond Pindharees. I laugh at you, and spit on your beards. If you want us, come and take us; but of our own accord we come not. Are we fools? are we asses? Oh, man! art thou one to talk thus? Go back to him that sent thee, and say the man is yet unborn who will take Ameer Ali Thug, so long as he has a weapon in his hand, or a few gallant fellows by his side. Have you no shame to deliver such a message!"</p></div> </div>
