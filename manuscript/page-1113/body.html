One of my fellows shall cook a good pilao, and after it we will enjoy the wine quietly."</p><p>"Your words are as sweet as the wine itself, good Meer Sahib; truly I will be with thee. I will tell my Saees to bring my horse and picket him among yours; no one will see me, and I will bring no one with me.
