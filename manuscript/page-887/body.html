Ameer Ali!" cried she, suddenly throwing off her veil and casting herself at my feet, while she buried her head in my lap; "Ameer Ali! this is my tale of shame&mdash;I love you! Alla only knows how my soul burns for you! I will be your slave for ever; whither you go, thither will I follow; whoever you are, and whatever you are, I am yours, and yours only; but I shall die without you. Alas! why did you come to me?"</p><p>And where now were all my resolutions? By Alla, Sahib, I had forgotten all&mdash;home, wife, children&mdash;I thought not of them, but I drank deeply of love, wild, passionate, burning love, from her eyes, and I caressed her as though she were mine own.</p></div> </div>
