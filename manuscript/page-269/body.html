<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It was only two nights ago&mdash;after watching till my eyes nearly started from my head from want of sleep, and, not being able to sit longer, I lay down and my eyes closed&mdash;that an attempt was made to cut my bags from under me; and, as I awoke, the thieves snatched away two of my cooking utensils and the cloth I had about me. What could I do? Had I run after them, some fellow would have been off with my bags; so I sat still, and screamed for help. The villagers were soon assembled about me, and when I told them what had happened, a villain, who called himself the patel, abused me for defaming his village; and I was actually thrust without the gates, and left to pursue my way in the dark, in momentary dread that I should be pursued, and perhaps robbed and murdered.</p></div> </div>
