But the night wanes, you had better make preparations for the journey; and let me offer you counsel; bring no one with you but a servant or two; my company is ample for your protection. I have a small pal which will hold us both; and, above all, bring not your son,&mdash;he will but fatigue himself for no good purpose, and be a clog on our rapid movements, for rapid they must be."</p><p>"I will follow your advice in all things, Meer Sahib. I shall bring no servants; the man who will drive my spare tattoo can attend me when I require it; and the less show I make, the less I shall be suspected of carrying money with me."</p></div> </div>
