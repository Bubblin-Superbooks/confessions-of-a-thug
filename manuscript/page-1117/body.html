"Last night, after I parted with you, Peer Khan, myself, and the others, made an offering of goor to the Nishan, and, blessed be Bhowanee, she has vouchsafed us the Thibao and Pilhao; you need, therefore, be under no apprehensions, for she is favourable."</p><p>"I was sure she would be, Motee, for I observe the hand of Alla guiding me; and I verily believe I should have followed the influence of my own desires in this matter, even had they been unfavourable."</p></div> </div>
