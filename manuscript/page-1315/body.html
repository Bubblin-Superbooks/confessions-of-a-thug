Give him to me; I will silence the crying wretch, and send him with his parents."</p><p>"Never!" cried I; "the boy is mine; you may have all the spoil, but give him up to death I will not. Have I not lost a son, and is it not lawful to adopt a child of this age?"</p><p>"Madness! madness!" cried Ganesha, "the boy must die.
