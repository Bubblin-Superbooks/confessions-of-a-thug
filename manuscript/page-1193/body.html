<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I have before mentioned to you the name of Ganesha Jemadar, he was always with us when not on the road, envying our quiet and respectable mode of life, which he could not attain by any means, though he left none untried. He bribed all the rajah's court, nay the rajah himself, to procure employment; but there was something so harsh and forbidding in his aspect, and so uncouth were his manners, that he did not succeed in what he so much longed for.</p><p>He came in despair to us, and after rating in no measured terms the conduct of the rajah and his officers, said that he was determined again to take to the road, for there alone he found occupation and amusement. He pressed me to accompany and join him, pictured in strong terms the booty we should gain and the glory we should win; and after many demurs and objections on my part, I finally agreed.</p></div> </div>
