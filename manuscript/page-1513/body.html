<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But fortune was against me, despite of this cheering commencement, and we did not long enjoy our easy and profitable career.</p><p>We had one day taken out of the city a party of seven travellers, we being sixteen Thugs in number. I well remember it was a Friday, an unlucky day at best. Among the Thugs was an old man, one of the old Murnae stock, a capital Bhuttote, who had joined us a short time before; he had known my father, and me when a child, and had recognized me in a street in Lukhnow, which led to his joining us. We had taken the travellers to a favourite bhil of ours about four coss distant, and were in the act of strangling them,&mdash;some even lay dead on the ground, and the rest were in their last agonies,&mdash;when by the merest chance a body of horse, which were on their way from the city to a distant pergunnah, came upon us.</p></div> </div>
