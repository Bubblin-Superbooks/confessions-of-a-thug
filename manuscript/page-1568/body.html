We were fatigued already, but the town was now so close to us that we did not hesitate to push on, and we arrived at the well-known spot shortly after dark. Selecting an empty shed in as lonely a part of the town as we could, we cooked a hasty meal and lay down, determined to rise before dawn and again pursue our journey. One of our number was set to watch ere we retired to rest, and we depended upon him to give us warning, should any suspicious person be observed.</p><p>The night passed, and I arose, roused my followers, and long before day had dawned we were beyond the gates of the town.</p></div> </div>
