At any rate, as this country always produces good booty for us, you will see us here pretty often."</p><p>"The oftener the better," said he; "and I must continue to keep my station here; it would be hard to lose such good friends. You, Potailjee, can help me to a few low caste rascals from time to time, to send in as thieves we have caught."</p><p>"Certainly," said the Potail&mdash;"there are plenty of Gonds and Dhï¿½rs in the country; every one knows they are thieves; and if they may not immediately have committed any robberies, they have been engaged in them some time or other, so that it is all the same. I will get you a few from time to time, as you want them."</p></div> </div>
