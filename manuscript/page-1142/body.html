<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The grave, a shallow one, was quickly dug; and while the Lughaees were preparing it, myself, Peer Khan and Motee unripped the lining and pockets of the saddle, and took out the gold. There was naught else. It was in coin, and in small lumps, as the jewels he had gotten in plunders had been melted down from time to time. We had no leisure then to speculate on its value; but we cut the saddle to pieces with our knives, to make sure that none remained in it; and the fragments were buried with the bodies.</p><p>"What shall we do with the horse, Meer Sahib?" asked Motee. "We cannot take him with us, for there is not a man in the camp who does not know Ghuffoor Khan's horse; and we have no time to stain him."</p></div> </div>
