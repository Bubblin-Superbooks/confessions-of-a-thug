<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Yes, Sahib, I deserved to be hanged for that deed, had I never done another; but I was spared for a different fate.</p><p>We were in full march on the third day after this happened, when we saw a body of horsemen coming after us. My mind misgave me when I observed them, and I hastened to collect the straggling Thugs, and form them into a close body, in case the horsemen should prove to be enemies, or make any hostile demonstration. On they came, shouting and abusing us in every term of vile reproach their tongues could utter. There were about forty of them; and I verily believe that, had I not been at the head of the band, they would have fled as one man: however, I cheered them up, and was determined to show a good front in my retreat.</p></div> </div>
