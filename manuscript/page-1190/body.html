Motee we never saw, but he must have died also, for the wound in his head had cut through the brain, and he never spoke.

I have been fed, and my blessings are on those who gave me food for the sake of the Prophet. What I have suffered I cannot describe; but I am now with you again, and your kindness has obliterated it all from my memory.</p></div> </div>
