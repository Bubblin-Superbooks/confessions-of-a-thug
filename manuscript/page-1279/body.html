I was glad that he had come, but not for what followed.</p><p>"Meer Sahib," said he, after a long silence, "I am not what I was,&mdash;I never shall be again; I am broken in spirit, and am no longer fit for my profession. My fate too points against it, and after this dreadful catastrophe I should be useless to you; permit me therefore to depart. You see I am calm and composed, and I do not say what I now urge on you in passion or grief; therefore let me depart.</p></div> </div>
