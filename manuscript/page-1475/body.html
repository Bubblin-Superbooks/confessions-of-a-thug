<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I bound my turban over my still burning and aching brow, so that man might not see my shame, and took the road before me. I wandered almost unconscious of anything, save the pain I was suffering, until night fell around me, and I directed my steps to a village, the lights of which were a short distance before me. Exchanging one of my rupees, I sat down at the shop of a Bhutteara and satisfied my craving appetite. There I slept, and when I arose I was refreshed, and again believed myself to be Ameer Ali. The morning breeze blew fresh on my face as I took my way out of the town; the refreshing rest of the night had invigorated me, and I bounded along with a light heart&mdash;yes, with a light heart,&mdash;for I was free! I had no thought for the past now. It was my fate which had been fulfilled: what had been written in my destiny had come to pass.</p></div> </div>
