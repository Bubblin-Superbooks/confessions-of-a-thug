Ah, Moonshee! you have influence with my judges&mdash;you can prevent my being sent away over the far sea, never to behold my country more, and to linger out the remnant of my days in a strange land condemned to work in irons. These hands have never been used to labour; how shall I endure it? Death is, indeed, welcome, compared with the Kala Panee."</p></div> </div>
