<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I presented the hilt of my sword as a nuzzur, and after touching it with his hand, he bid me be seated near him on the carpet. This I was too polite to do; so, excusing myself on the ground of unworthiness of such honour, I seated myself on my heels on the edge of the carpet, and placed my sword and shield before me. The sword immediately attracted his attention. "That is a noble weapon, Meer Sahib," said he; "may I be allowed to look at it?"</p><p>"Certainly," said I, presenting the hilt; "the sword is at my lord's service."</p><p>"Nay, Meer Sahib, I want it not; but I am curious in these matters, and have a choice collection, which I will one day show you."</p></div> </div>
