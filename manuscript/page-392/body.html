<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As I entered the town I saw Bhudrinath in a shop, sitting with his back to the street, in conversation with a decent-looking man, a Moosulman by his appearance. He did not observe me, but on my calling out his assumed name he hastily rose, and assisting me to dismount, embraced me cordially. "Is she safe?" I asked in a low tone, so as not to be overheard by his acquaintance.</p><p>"She is," he replied; "you have nothing to fear; and she is all impatience to behold you again."</p><p>Sahib, I did not lose an instant in again beholding my beloved and pressing her once more to my heart. She was more lovely than ever; and after some fond chidings for my delay, and a relation of all the anxiety she had suffered in my absence, and the fatigues of her journey, we gave ourselves up to that voluptuous feeling of joy and security, which those only know who have loved and been separated from each other under circumstances of doubt or danger.</p></div> </div>
