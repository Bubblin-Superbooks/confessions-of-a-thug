<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> One and all reviled me in the most opprobrious terms they could devise,&mdash;me! the respectable, nay the wealthy, to whom they had bowed before, when I basked in the sunshine of the Rajah's favour&mdash;but I was degraded now. Alas! my dreams, my forebodings had come to pass&mdash;they had been indefinite shadows&mdash;this was the reality. Alla! Alla! I raved, I called upon Azima's name, I implored those who still lingered about my prison to fly and bring me news of her, and to comfort her; and I cursed them when they derided me, and mocked my cries. Azima, the name that might not have been breathed by mortal out of the precincts of my zenana, became a word in the mouths of the rabble, and they jested on it, they loaded it with obscene abuse, and I heard it all. In vain I strove to stop my ears,&mdash;it provoked them the more; they shouted it close to the iron bars and spat at me.</p></div> </div>
