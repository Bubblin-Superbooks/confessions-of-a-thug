But it was dangerous, as they were individually stouter men than we were, good hands at their weapons, and as watchful as cats.</p><p>The second day Goordut and his party joined us but it was as much as I could do to persuade the Rokurreas to allow them to travel in our company. They declared it was directly against their rules; that we must be aware of this, and that, if it was known by their employers that they even admitted one traveller into their society on the road, they would lose their reputation and means of subsistence.</p></div> </div>
