Women, wine, horses, and arms are his enjoyments; reckless of everything, he plunges into dissipation, sets his parents at defiance, runs into debt, is surrounded by sharpers and parasites, who despoil him of all he possesses; and he had given himself up to harlots and debauchery; and this ends the second part. His father dies&mdash;he is now Nuwab; he is the head of a proud house, has men and soldiers at his command, and his territory to manage.</p></div> </div>
