His upper lip is graced with a pair of small mustachios, which would be the envy of many a gay lieutenant of hussars; while a beard close and wavy, from which a straggling hair is never suffered to escape, descends nearly to his breast, and hides a throat and neck which would be a study for a painter or a sculptor. To complete all, his chest is very broad and prominent, and well contrasts with the effect of his small waist.</p><p>His manner is graceful, bland, and polite&mdash;it is, indeed, more than gentleman-like&mdash;it is courtly; and I have not seen it equalled even by the Mahomedan noblemen, with many of whom I have associated.</p></div> </div>
