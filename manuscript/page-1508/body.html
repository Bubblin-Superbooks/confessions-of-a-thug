<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I wept! yes, I sat at the threshold of what had been my own home and wept, yet not aloud. My eyes were a fountain of tears, and they welled over their lids, and coursed down my rough visage, and fell hot upon my hands. My memory was busy with the past, that period of bliss when all earthly joy was my portion, and with it wealth and fame. All was gone&mdash;gone like the fleeting dream&mdash;a mockery, which, gorgeous or blissful as it may be while it possesses the sleeping senses, is broken&mdash;even the remembrance of it lost&mdash;by awakening to reality. Alla help me! I said, in the bitterness of my heart at that moment; I am, indeed, desolate, and it matters not what becomes of me: I have no hope.</p></div> </div>
