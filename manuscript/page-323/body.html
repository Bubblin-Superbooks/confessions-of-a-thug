By the way we met with our friend the Kotwal; but I cut him short with "Another time, Kotwaljee,"&mdash;for it seemed as though we were to have a long story&mdash;"another time, my friend, we will pay you a visit; but at present the matter we have in hand is urgent, and it being past noon we are afraid of being denied admittance, and so you must excuse us."</p></div> </div>
