And when did a Brahmin of Bindachul ever break his faith? He dare not: Bhowanee would smite him on the spot, or kill him by lingering torments."</p><p>"And how," I asked, "are we to convey this share to him, whatever it may turn out to be?"</p><p>"Easily enough; we can get a hoondee on this place, and send it to him in a letter, or we can despatch a man with it."</p><p>"True, we can," said I; "and so now go; repeat to the men the lesson I taught them, and enjoin them to be circumspect and wary. We have good bunij in prospect, and, Inshalla! we will get it, too. But I wish I could see the Brahmin, who has done us so good a turn in this matter."</p></div> </div>
