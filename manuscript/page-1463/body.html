<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For a time all was oblivion; but horrible dreams began to crowd my prison with unsightly shapes and harrowing visions; my life passed as though in review before me, and the features of many I had strangled rose up in fierce mockery against me,&mdash;faces with protruding tongues and eyes, even as I had left them strangled.</p><p>Why describe them to you, Sahib? why detain you with a description of the horrors of the scenes which rose to my distempered fancy, and at last woke me, burning as though a fire raged in my bowels, and would not be quenched? But morning broke at last, and the cool air once more played over my heated and fevered frame, and refreshed me. Yet I was still in agony;&mdash;who can describe the sufferings of thirst? Hunger I felt not: thirst consumed me, and dried up my bowels.</p></div> </div>
