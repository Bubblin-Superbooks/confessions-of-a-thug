<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Yes, I was to die! to expire of thirst and hunger; and then, oh how I envied my father's fate! his was a quick transition from the sorrows and suffering he had undergone during one short hour, to Paradise and the houris.</p><p>And from evening, night, I had watched the declining sun, till its last fiery and scorching beams fell no longer on my prison-floor&mdash;I watched the reddened west until no glare remained, and one by one the stars shone out dimly through the thick and heated air&mdash;and I thought I should see the blessed day no more, for I was sick and exhausted even to death. I lay me down and moaned, in my agony of spirit and of body, and at last sleep came to my relief.</p></div> </div>
