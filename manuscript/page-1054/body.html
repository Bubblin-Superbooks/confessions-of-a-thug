<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We passed Mungrool; and beyond the town, now in the broad daylight, I had an opportunity of seeing the spot where my first victim had fallen. I had thought that the place where he fell was in a large and dense jungle, so at least it appeared that night in the moonlight,&mdash;but it was not so; the rivulet was the same as when we had passed it, and I stood once more on the very spot where the Sahoukar had fallen! A thin belt of bushes fringed the stream, and Peer Khan pointed with a significant gesture a little higher up than the place at which we crossed. It was the bhil where they were buried, and it now seemed a fearfully insecure spot for the concealment of our victims,&mdash;so close to the road, and apparently so thinly screened from observation.</p></div> </div>
