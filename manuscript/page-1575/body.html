<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I should be hung&mdash;hung like a dog! I who ought to have died on a battle-field! there death would have been sweet, and followed by an everlasting Paradise. Alas! even this hope deserted me now, and I felt that the load of crime with which my soul was oppressed would weigh me down into hell.</p><p>Who can describe the myriad thoughts which crowd into the heart at such a moment? One by one they hurry in, each striving to displace the foregoing&mdash;none staying for an instant,&mdash;till the brain reels under the confusion. It was thus with me. I walked mechanically, surrounded by the soldiers, vainly striving to collect my wandering senses to sustain me in the coming scene&mdash;the scene of death; for I verily believed I should be led to instant execution. Why should the mockery of a trial be given to one so steeped in crime as I was?</p></div> </div>
