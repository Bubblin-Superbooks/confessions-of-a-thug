Well do I remember waving my sword to my companions&mdash;whose numbers were now swelled to nearly five hundred splendid fellows, often increased by parties from the rear,&mdash;as I showed them the broad plains of Berar, and told them that we had unlimited power to plunder as we listed!</p><p>Ghuffoor Khan envied me that day; he had been detained with Cheetoo, who remained with the main body, while my own Harawul was increased, in order that I might advance and surround Oomraotee. On we dashed! The few villages we surprised were quickly laid under contribution;</p></div> </div>
