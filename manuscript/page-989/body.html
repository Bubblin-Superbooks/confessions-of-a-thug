Alla knows that two days ago I had never had a spear in my hand. I only observed what you did when you hit me, and to my good horse I owe my fortune. But it was all chance; and though I prize the victory, yet I regret that such a chance should have hurt you."</p><p>"Nay, I am not hurt, Syud," he replied; "and I bear these things with good humour; but if you are as good a hand with the sword as you promise to be with the spear, there will not be a man in the camp to stand before you."</p></div> </div>
