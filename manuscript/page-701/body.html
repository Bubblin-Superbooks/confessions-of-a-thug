When you travel post, we might possibly get a few rupees from your palankeens, but you are generally armed; you usually carry pistols, and some of us must undoubtedly fall before we could effect our object; but above all, there would be such a hue and cry if any of you were missing that it would be impossible to escape, especially as any property we might take from you would assuredly lead to our detection."</p><p>"Your reasons are weighty," said I laughing; "but I suspect, Ameer Ali, you do not like the pistols, and that is the reason we have escaped you: but go on with your story; I have interrupted you."</p></div> </div>
