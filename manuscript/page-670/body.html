One of our small tents had been pitched for Azima, and after seeing her settled for the night I joined my father.</p><p>"You are a lucky fellow," said he, when I had told him of all my success; "I have been in anxious suspense about you, especially when the evening set in and you came not; but now there is no danger, we are once again in the country and the roads are our own. And now tell me, what is your new bride like? is she as handsome as Zora?"</p></div> </div>
