"A deep blow has been struck at Thuggee in the capture of this villain," said he, "and thou hast done thy duty well, Ameer Ali."</p><p>From that hour I rose in his confidence and estimation, and I have never forfeited it. Ganesha's trial came on, and I was the principal witness against him. I told all I knew of the murders he had committed, and others corroborated my statements in the fullest manner. He was sentenced to die.</p><p>In vain was it that I entreated to see him before his execution; I wanted to taunt him with his fate, and to embitter his last hours, if anything I could have said might have done so. It was denied me; the officer knew of my purpose, and was too humane to allow it.</p></div> </div>
