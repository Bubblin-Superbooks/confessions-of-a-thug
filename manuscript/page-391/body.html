Tell the men to be prepared."</p><p>We were on our way towards Nirmul in the afternoon, and as we had heard no more of the Nuwab and his distress, we were relieved from our anxiety; but I was in great dread the whole time we remained at the town after the Nuwab's people had left us, lest some chance should open to them a clue to detect us. The Bhutteara might possibly reveal what he knew of our proceedings; for although he knew not our object, still our remaining with him for so short a time (as he must have formed a notion that we were after some woman), coupled with the disappearance of Zora, might have led him to suppose, and very naturally so, that we had carried her off. Fortunately, however, no ill effects did ensue, and on the third day after leaving Oomerkhï¿½r we reached Nirmul.</p></div> </div>
