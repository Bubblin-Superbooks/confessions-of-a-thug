We lifted it up and got him out; but he was either so frightened or hurt he could not speak. At last he recovered; and the first words he uttered were a volley of abuse at the driver.</p><p>"Look!" cried he; "a smooth road, not a stone or a pebble, and yet that son of a base mother must needs drive up yonder bank, and has nearly killed me."</p><p>"He shall be well punished for his carelessness," said I; "but are you hurt, Khan?"</p><p>"My right arm is very painful," said he, holding it; "and I wish to Alla I had a horse to ride, instead of going further in that concern."</p></div> </div>
