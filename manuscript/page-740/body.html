"And yet he moves not&mdash;he speaks not;" and she gazed on his features for a moment. "Ah!" she screamed, "look at his eyes, look at them&mdash;they will fall out of his head! And his countenance&mdash;'tis not my own lord's; those are not the lips which have often spoken kind words to his poor Kureena! Oh, my heart, what a pain is there!"</p></div> </div>
