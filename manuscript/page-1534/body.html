<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Months rolled on. Though only a strong grating of iron bars divided me from my old companion, we seldom spoke to each other; at most it was a word, a passing remark hazarded by the one, and scarcely heeded by the other, so absorbed were we in our misery. I ate and drank mechanically, I had no craving for food; and what they gave us to eat was of the coarsest kind. The filth which accumulated in our cells was removed only once a week, and it bred vermin which sorely tormented us. Oh that I could die! I cried a thousand times a day. Alas! my prayer was not granted.</p><p>The second year of our captivity passed&mdash;the same unvarying rotation of misery&mdash;no change, no amelioration of our condition. We existed, but no more; the energies of life were dead within us.</p></div> </div>
