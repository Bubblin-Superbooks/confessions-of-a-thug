<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>They left me, and I mused over my lot. I was to die; that was determined. Did I fear death? not at first; I looked at the transition as one that would lead me to eternal joys&mdash;to Paradise&mdash;to my father and Azima. But as I thought again and again, other reflections crowded on my spirit: I was to die, but how? not like a man or a soldier, but like a miserable thief, the scorn of thousands who would exult in my dying struggles; and then I remembered those of the wretch who had been hung before my eyes when Bhudrinath was with me, and I pictured to myself the agony he must have suffered ere life was extinct&mdash;the shame of the death&mdash;the ignominy which would never leave my memory. All these weighed heavily on me.</p></div> </div>
