I waited very impatiently till towards evening, when, as I was sitting at the door of my tent, I saw a man on horseback, attended by a small retinue, among whom, to my great astonishment, was a young good-looking girl, mounted on a spirited pony, coming down the road from the city. He passed near our camp, and, crossing the river, ascended the opposite bank and entered the Durgah. Was this my new victim? I was not long in suspense: a message soon came from the Moola requesting my company; and taking my sword and shield with me, I followed the man who had come to call me.</p><p>Seated with the old Moola I have before mentioned, the Nuwab Subzee Khan Buhadoor (for by that name alone I knew him) was quaffing his bitter and intoxicating draught.</p></div> </div>
