<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sahib, after that fatal relation, I know not what I did for many days. I believe I raved, and they thought me mad, but my mind was strong and not to be overthrown. I recovered, though slowly, and again and again I retraced in my memory the whole of my life till that miserable day on which I murdered my sister! It could have been no other.</p><p>I tried in vain to cheat myself into the belief that it was another, but no effort that I made could shake the conviction that it was she. My unaccountable recollection of Eklï¿½ra&mdash;the relation of my father's death by the old man there&mdash;his almost recognition of me&mdash;and, more than all, the old and worthless coin for which I destroyed her, and which I now remembered perfectly&mdash;all were undeniable proofs of my crime; and conviction, though I tried to shut it out, entered into my soul, and abode there.</p></div> </div>
