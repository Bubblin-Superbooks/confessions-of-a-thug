I asked, in a low tone.</p><p>"Eleven," said he; "the rest I fear have fallen."</p><p>"I pray Alla they have; better far to fall by a sword-cut or a spear-thrust, than to be exposed to torture; but who are absent?&mdash;is Motee here?"</p><p>"Alas! no, Meer Sahib. Motee I saw struck down. I made a cut at the Pindharee who wounded him, but the darkness deceived me: I missed him."</p><p>"And who else are absent?" said I, stifling my grief, for Motee had been as a brother to me; "let those who are here tell their names."</p></div> </div>
