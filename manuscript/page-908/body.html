But I had now fairly met my match, and though abashed for a moment, I replied to her: "Then, Shurfun, since you have discovered us, I have no alternative, we must be united, I to save my life and the lives of my men, you to save your own. It is a fearful tie which binds us, but it cannot be broken."</p><p>"I thought so," she said; "fool that I was not to have urged this before! I might have saved myself the agony which I have endured.
