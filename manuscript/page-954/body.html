<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Sahib, I thought my end was come; but I had time to disengage my shield from my back, and held it before me in defence while I tugged in very desperation at my weapon.</p><p>Praise be to Alla! it yielded to my great exertion, and we were on equal terms. I have before told you of my skill as a swordsman, but I had met my match in the Rokurrea: he, though all his men were lying around him save one,&mdash;who, having sorely wounded my poor attendant, was now closely pressed by Peer Khan and another,&mdash;was as cool and wary as myself. We fought well, and for a long time the contest was equal; we were both out of breath, and our shields hacked with the repeated blows we had each caught on them;</p></div> </div>
