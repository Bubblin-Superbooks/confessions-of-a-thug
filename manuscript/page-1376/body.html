<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Short greetings were exchanged between us, a few inquiries as to the road, whether water was to be had, and where, and we passed on.</p><p>Our booty was small enough, as you may conceive,&mdash;about forty rupees, a few changes of raiment, the tattoo of the deceased, and the few and simple ornaments of the women, worth perhaps a hundred rupees, were all we got. But I had the real prize, worth in my eyes thousands of rupees. No one knew I had it, and I kept it hung round my own neck, and close to my heart. A thousand times I took it out and gazed at it; there was something about it which had a mysterious effect on me,&mdash;many times I thought I had seen it before, and I fancied its old and battered surface was familiar to me. But my mind gave me no clue to the idea, and I attributed the effect I have described to the influence of the charm itself, and I was assured of its potency.</p></div> </div>
