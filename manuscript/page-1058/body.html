A few hundred men attempted to defend the town, but it was carried by forcing open the gate, and plundered. We lost some of our men, and I was grazed on the leg by a bullet, and disabled from taking any active part in the sack of the place. Peer Khan and Motee were, however, not idle, and brought a goodly heap of jewels and coin to swell the general stock.</p><p>From hence we penetrated southward. Beeder, Bhalkee, the fine and flourishing town of Hoomnabad (a second Oomraotee), were severally plundered, or laid under heavy contributions; while every village which lay in our route was sacked, and too often burned and destroyed.</p></div> </div>
