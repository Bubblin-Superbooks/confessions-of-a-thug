<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I have found out from the villagers that about four coss hence there is a small stream with plenty of water; the banks are covered with jungle, as thick as we could desire, and I have fixed on that as the place. Shall we send on the Lughaees?"</p><p>"Certainly," said Bhudrinath: "we may as well be prepared:&mdash;but no," continued he, "what would be the use of it? If the jungle is as thick as you say it is, we can easily conceal the bodies; and at any rate, as there is a river, a grave can soon be made in the sand or gravel. But the Nuwab is a powerful man, Meer Sahib; you had better not risk yourself alone with him; as for the rest, the men have secured them,&mdash;that is, they have arranged already who are to do their business."</p></div> </div>
