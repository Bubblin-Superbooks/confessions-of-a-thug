<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We reached the village we wished to gain&mdash;a miserable hamlet called Biseynee; but the Potail was in our interest, and a present of twenty rupees now and then, with sometimes a new turban, gained us his silence and co-operation. I say co-operation, for he often gave over passengers to Thugs, by declaring that his village was unsafe, and that they must go and encamp outside with the rest&mdash;who were the Thugs. He knew well what would become of them; but he was, as I have said, paid for his treachery.</p><p>Well, we reached Biseynee. I had purchased for the worthy Potail a handsome turban and waistband, and had prepared for him a number of other articles, one of which was an English pistol, which he had sent word by a Thug that I was to purchase for him.</p></div> </div>
