The arrangements were quickly completed, and though we were all within only a few yards of the bushes, there was no sign of the tigress. She expressed no displeasure at our near approach or preparations, as she had been disturbed before, and of course could not easily be driven out of her place of refuge.

We waited a few minutes, and one of the party who had been sent round, appeared on the top of the rock; he was soon followed by three others.</p></div> </div>
