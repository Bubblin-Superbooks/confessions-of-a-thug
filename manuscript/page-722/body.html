"Ameer Ali," said my father, coming to me shortly afterwards, "is the Nuwab to be ours or not? If you have invited him as a guest, say so? if not, you had better arrange something."</p><p>"A guest!" cried I; "oh no: he must be disposed of; there can be no difficulty where there so many good places to destroy him."</p><p>"Impossible!" said my father; "on horseback it would be madness.
