"He will not enter," said he; "and says that you will know him when you see him."</p><p>I took up my sword and followed him. It was dusk, and I did not recognise the features of the person who had sent for me; indeed he was so closely muffled that I could hardly see them. "What is your purpose, friend?" I asked, as the man did not speak, but motioned with his arms under his cloth for my attendant to go away. I bid him begone.</p></div> </div>
