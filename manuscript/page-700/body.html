<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A momentary thought flashed across me&mdash;that the Nuwab was a man of war, that he would be armed to the teeth; and who was I, that I could oppose him? but I dismissed it in an instant as unworthy. My confidence in my own prowess, both as a Thug and with every weapon, whether on foot or on horseback, was unbounded; it had never as yet been checked, and I feared nothing living, I believe, in the form of man.</p><p>"Yes, Ameer Ali," said I, "you and all your tribe have ever feared us Englishmen. You have never yet attacked one of us, nor dared you."</p><p>The Thug laughed.&mdash;"No, Sahib, you are wrong; we never feared you, but to attack any of you would have been impossible. When you travel on horseback you are not worth attacking, for you never carry anything about your persons.</p></div> </div>
