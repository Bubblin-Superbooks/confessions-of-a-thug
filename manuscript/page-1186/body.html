I exclaimed, 'it is of no use to contend further with destiny; were we a thousand times innocent, this array of facts against us would convict us. I now conceal not that we are Thugs&mdash;followers of the blessed Bhowanee, who will receive us into Paradise. We shall die by your command, but why should that vile wretch live?&mdash;he who, for a greedy demand of more than his share, which he knew he could not receive according to our laws, has denounced us, has broken his oath, and been unfaithful to the salt he has eaten? Is he not a Thug? has he not joined me and a hundred others in our work ever since he was a boy? He cannot deny it; look at him,&mdash;look at his cowardly features convulsed by terror,&mdash;they show that what I say is true.</p></div> </div>
